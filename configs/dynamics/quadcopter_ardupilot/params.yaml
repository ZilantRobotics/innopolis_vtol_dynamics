# QuadCopter Dynamics Configuration for ArduCopter
# This configuration file defines the dynamics properties for a general quadcopter model
# with a total mass of 2 kg. It is designed specifically for HITL (Hardware-in-the-Loop)
# simulation in an ArduPilot environment, aiming to replicate the behavior of a real-world drone.
#
# Key Assumptions:
# - The quadcopter follows a symmetric X-frame design.
# - The drone uses four identical motors and propellers, with a thrust-to-weight ratio
#   sufficient for stable flight.
# - Dynamics parameters align with the default PID tuning of ArduPilot to minimize
#   the need for manual adjustments.

# The total mass of the vehicle, including the frame, motors, ESCs, and payload.
vehicle_mass :              2.0       # kg

# This represents the response time of the motor to changes in input for brushless motors with ESCs
# Higher-quality ESCs and motors may have a faster response (closer to 0.02 sec).
# Slower or less efficient systems may be closer to 0.05 sec.
motor_time_constant:        0.02      # sec

# The rotational inertia of the motor and propeller system.
# Depends on the size and weight of the propeller and motor rotor.
# Typical value: 0.00002–0.00006 kg·m² for standard 10–12 inch propellers.
# Smaller drones with lighter props will have lower values.
motor_rotational_inertia:   6.62e-6   # kg·m²

# This coefficient relates motor rotational speed to generated thrust.
# Higher values indicate more thrust is produced for a given RPM.
thrust_coefficient:         1.91e-6   # N/(rad/s)^2"

# This coefficient relates motor rotational speed to generated torque.
# Torque impacts the drone's rotational dynamics (yaw).
torque_coefficient:         2.6e-7    # Nm/(rad/s)^2

# Represents the aerodynamic drag acting on the drone.
# Higher values indicate more resistance to motion through the air.
drag_coefficient:           0.1       # N/(m/s)

# Coefficient representing aerodynamic moments acting about the axis.
# This can arise from asymmetries in the propeller wash or frame.

aeromoment_coefficient_yy:  0.003     # Nm/(rad/s)^2
aeromoment_coefficient_zz:  0.003     # Nm/(rad/s)^2

# The moment of inertia about the X or Y-axis, affecting roll or pitch dynamics.
# Larger values indicate more resistance to angular acceleration in roll or pitch.
vehicle_inertia_xx:         0.045     # kg * m^2
vehicle_inertia_yy:         0.045     # kg * m^2

# Low value -> the yaw oscillations.
# High value -> slow response on yaw inputs and it may feel "lazy" in maintaining the commanded yaw angle.
vehicle_inertia_zz:         0.045     # kg * m^2

# The maximum rotational speed of the propeller.
# Determines the upper limit of thrust and torque generation.
max_prop_speed:             2200      # rad/s

# The process noise for the moment and force estimation in the filter.
# Lower values indicate more confidence in model accuracy.
moment_process_noise:       1.25e-7   # (Nm)^2 s
force_process_noise:        0.0005    # N^2 s"

# The perpendicular distance between a force's line of action (such as thrust
# or lift) and the center of mass (or the axis of rotation) of the UAV
